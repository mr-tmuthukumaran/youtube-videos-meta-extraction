https://www.youtube.com/@theMITmonk,UC4ZVkG3RQPzvZk7alIVjcCg,theMITmonk,"From homeless to billion-dollar boardrooms. From monk training to MIT. From stage concerts to M&A... I’ve lived more lives than a cat.

I've served as CEO and C-level exec at tech companies that created $40B+ in value. I also crashed and burned too. Failure teaches much faster than success.

Before business, I performed 1,000+ concerts with Grammy winners. As a teenager, I ran away from home, wandering, homeless, training as a monk. That's all I wanted to be. Really.

But somehow I ended up at MIT, surrounded by friends and mentors who fixed what was deeply broken.

That's why The MIT Monk channel. To provide guidance I desperately needed but never got. No chest-beating, rage-baiting, or get-rich-quick noise. Science, strategy, spirituality, and stories from a friend who’s been there, warts and all.

I live in the NYC area, serving on boards, advising AI startups and help ambitious leaders scale without losing themselves.

It's so awesome to see you here. Thank you, and I love you.
